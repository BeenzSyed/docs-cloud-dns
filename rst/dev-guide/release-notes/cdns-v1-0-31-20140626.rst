What's new
~~~~~~~~~~
 
- The "Search Domains with Filtering" functionality has been modified to increase performance.
  A request to ``GET /domains?name=domainName`` now returns exact
  matches only. Refer to :rax-devdocs:`List domains by name <cloud-dns/v1/developer-guide/#list-domains-by-name>`
  for details.
