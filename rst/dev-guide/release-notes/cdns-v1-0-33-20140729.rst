Resolved issues
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Improved the performance of requests to retrieve subdomains (see the  
  :rax-devdocs:`List subdomains <cloud-dns/v1/developer-guide/#list-subdomains>` and 
  :rax-devdocs:`Show domain <cloud-dns/v1/developer-guide/#show-domain>` sections).
- Added support for exporting TXT records that have multiple strings in
  the data field. TXT records that have multiple strings in the data field to work around 
  the 255-byte maximum length of a string within a single TXT record are now successfully 
  exported.
