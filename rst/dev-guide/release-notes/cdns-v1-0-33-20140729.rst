Resolved issues
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Improved the performance of subdomain(s) retrieval requests (see the sections 
  :rax-devdocs:`List subdomains <cloud-dns/v1/developer-guide/#list-subdomains>` and 
  :rax-devdocs:`Show domain <cloud-dns/v1/developer-guide/#show-domain>`).
- When exporting domains, support exporting TXT records that have multiple strings in
  the data field. TXT records that have multiple strings in the data field to work around 
  the 255-byte maximum length of a string within a single TXT record are now successfully 
  exported.
