About the Rackspace Managed DNS API
-----------------------------------------

|product name| is a globally distributed (Anycast network) service that 
allows Rackspace customers to manage Domain Name System (DNS) zones and resource records

programmatically via the API described in this |product name| Developer Guide.

|product name| is powered by OpenStack Designate v2.0 (DNSaaS). Duplicate zones and 
resource records may not exist between Rackspace Cloud DNS and |product name|.

..  note:: 

	-  |product name| is currently limited to Rackspace Cloud accounts.

	-  PTR records are currently supported in Rackspace Cloud DNS, but will not be supported 
	   by |product name| until the Unlimited Availability launch phase.
