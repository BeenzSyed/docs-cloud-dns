Pyrax Upgrade Dependency – Enabling Rackspace Managed DNS (Early Access) will block use of 
Rackspace Cloud DNS (Production) for users of pyrax versions earlier than 1.9.7.  In order 
to enable accounts for Managed DNS (Early Access) without impacting current pyrax usage in 
Cloud DNS, participating customers with a workflow that is dependent on Rackspace Cloud 
SDK "pyrax” will need to upgrade to the latest version (1.9.7).  Additionally, users of 
Ansible's Rackspace modules would also have to upgrade the pyrax dependency before 
associated accounts can be enabled for Managed DNS (Early Access).
