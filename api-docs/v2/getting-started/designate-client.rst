How the Designate client works
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Designate client Command Line Interface (CLI) is now a plugin for OpenStack CLI.

You install the CLI clients on a Linux distribution or on Mac OS X. Learn how to install 
the CLI clients in the following section "Install the CLI Clients".

To configure the trove client, you update your .bash_profile file (or
.bashrc) to set and export trove environment variables.

..  note:: 

    You can specify the ``--debug`` parameter on any trove command to show the underlying 
    API request for the command. This is a good way to become familiar with the API requests.
