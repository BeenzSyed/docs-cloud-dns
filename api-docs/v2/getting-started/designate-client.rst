How the Designate Command Line Interface Works
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Designate Command Line Interface (CLI) is now a plugin for OpenStack CLI.

You install the CLI clients on a Linux distribution or on Mac OS X. Learn how to install 
the CLI clients in the following section "Install the CLI Clients".

To configure the Designate client, you update your .bash_profile file (or
.bashrc) to set and export Designate environment variables.

..  note:: 

    You can specify the ``--debug`` parameter on any Designate command to show the underlying 
    API request for the command. This is a good way to become familiar with the API requests.
