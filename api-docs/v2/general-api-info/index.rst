General API information
-------------------------

The |apiservice| is implemented using a ReSTful web service interface. Like other products 
in the Rackspace Cloud suite, the DNS service shares a common token-based authentication 
system that allows seamless access between products and services.

.. note:: 
   
   All requests to authenticate and operate the service are performed using SSL over HTTP 
   (HTTPS) on TCP port 443.
